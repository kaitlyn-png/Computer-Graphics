# TODO

Game: have to break at least 10 logs and 4 hay to complete the game --> resets

WHERE THE MOUSE LOOKS IS WHERE THE BLOCKS WILL BREAK AND BE PLACED --> need to use raycasting

Camera movement: able to look up and down without it scaling weirdly like you are in the air --> keep X axis while looking up and down like a minecraft character

Fix sky texture

Fix height map logic: set to whatever height of the blocks = what blocks they are

Fix break and place blocks

Fix UV texture for sky

Optional: scratch the height map --> height = block logic fixed --> can break log and have the other logs hovering like in minecraft so the top bottom texture is visible

Questions: do i need solid color blocks, i feel like that takes away from the minecraft world --> was just gonna make the sky all blue but wanted to use the UV textures
